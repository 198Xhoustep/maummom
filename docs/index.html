								I am a performing artist who expresses street dance and contemporary dance in the style of Korean dance. I am currently working on interpreting the original movements that have been forgotten and disappeared, and reinterpreting them through dance as a form of art and shamanism.

									<p>In 2019, I joined the traditional music group "Maro" in Jeju and started looking at the original form of Jeju culture and seeking the flow of the world. I am yearning for a purer and more primitive form of art by finding the root of dance and going back to the original form of art.</p>

							<h2>Philosophy</h2>
							<p>Dance is a primitive art that existed before language. Like all art, the origin of dance can be found in ancient rituals and festivals of both the East and the West. Dance serves not only as a tool to express physical beauty or metaphysical themes, but also as a means of catharsis and energy exchange through the immersion of body, mind, and spirit. However, contemporary dance is a visible art, so the unseen and unexperienced lines and shamanic world are considered ancient myths. Now, I am working on interpreting the movements of the original form that have been forgotten and disappeared in Jeju, and reinterpreting them through dance as a form of art and shamanism..</p>
