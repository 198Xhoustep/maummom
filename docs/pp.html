                    <p>
                        I have previously operated a studio called "Maeummom" in Jeju Island for nine years.
                    
                        The studio has been selected for local cultural and arts support programs by the Jeju Cultural Foundation from 2014 to 2021.
                    
                        We teach movement-based classes with a focus on ballet, hip-hop, and contemporary dance.
                    <p>
                        With over 20 years of experience and achievements in the Korean performing arts and education industry,
                    
                        my goal is to create a studio that shares the knowledge and expertise with the local community.


                    
                        Our studio will offer a variety of classes, including ballet, hip-hop, contemporary, and other movement-based classes.
                    
                        We will have a team of experienced and qualified instructors who will provide high-quality dance education to our students.


                    <p>Maummom studio will provide high-quality dance education and workshops to children and young adults in the region.
                   With our experienced and qualified instructors, we will share our knowledge and expertise in the performing arts industry.
                    We believe that our unique approach to teaching movement-based classes will set us apart from our competitors and provide a valuable service to the local community.
