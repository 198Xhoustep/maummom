								I started dancing in high school in 1999, and my street dance style became a unique trend in areas such as Gangnam and Hongdae. In 2006, I became involved with House Rules, a brand that combined parties, music, and dance. In 2008, House Rules won the Mnet Rookie Singer Award, and I went on to participate in various activities such as Immortal Songs and music broadcasts. In 2008, I was invited to perform as a guest in a contemporary dance performance in Frankfurt, Germany, which led me to expand my range of dance to include contemporary dance. I enrolled in the Korea National University of Arts and studied various aspects of performing arts. As a result, in 2014 and 2016, I participated in the National Dance Company of Korea's "Dance Speaks" production, as a former member of the An Ae-soon Dance Company.

								In 2010, I became acquainted with Platoon Kunsthalle, which appeared in Nonhyeon-dong, and was exposed to experimental and multi-dimensional art, collaborating with overseas artists. In 2014, I moved to Jeju Island and worked as a guest dancer for the Jeju Provincial Dance Company. In 2016 and 2018, I was selected as a new artist in Jeju and presented my own work.

							<p>In 2019, I joined the traditional music group "Maro" in Jeju and started looking at the original form of Jeju culture and seeking the flow of the world. I am yearning for a purer and more primitive form of art by finding the root of dance and going back to the original form of art
